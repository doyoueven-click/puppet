# DYEC Puppet

These docs are meant to discuss puppet and this code more in-depth than can be
done in a README.

- [Puppet Intro](./puppet-intro.md)
- [How Puppet Runs](./runtime.md)
- [Puppetfile & Dependencies](./puppetfile.md)

(Tip: These docs can also be browsed with [Frogmouth](https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth) if you
want something formatted.)
